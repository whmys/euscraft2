You can use the command `/trigger sethome` to set your home, and then warp back using `/trigger home`. You can only have 1 home at a time, and you must stand still for 1 second when warping.

You can also use the command `/trigger spawn` to warp to the server spawn.
## Nicknames
To give yourself a nickname, use the command `/nick set <colour>[NICKNAME]
`. For example, if I wanted my nickname to be 'Captain Cairn' in all red, I would run the command `/nick set <red>Captain Cairn`. More information on colours can be found [here](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/#colors).
